A name is not just what you’re called, it is who you are. It is what you stand for and ultimately defanes you as a person. Growing up, I used to think my name did not fit me and that nothing that my name stood for had anything to do with me. Now that I am older, I understand the real meaning of my name and how the traits that are connectedwith my name relate to the person that I have become and continue to develop into. My name represets who I am and who I plan to be. 

According to the Internet, the name Riley represents a seek in change, new opportunuties and new challenges. With this description, I feel as though my name fits who I am. Growning up my life changed frequntly; even though I hated how much it did change back then, it has made me the person I am today. With change, I would challenge myself to adjust to the change. This has reflected in my everyday life, because I chalenge myself to do better and succeed.  

It also means that I tell the truth and I can be blunt. Most of the time, when asked for my input I give my honest opinion and will not back down. In many situations in my life, it has been very important to give my thougts on a situation that would change my life. For examle, when my parents got divorced, I had to choose which parent I wanted to live with and I couldn’t choose just to make that one parent happy. When a friend needs me, I will help them and give them the anser that they may or may not want to hear. However, it helps them come up with a decission on what they need to do. 

In conclusion, I would like to say that I like my name and the wonderful meaning that it has. I hope your name has the same hidden meaning.
